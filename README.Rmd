The goal of silk is to make curves with outliers smooth as silk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of silk from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TeroJii/silk")
```

## Example

The objective of this package is to provide a simple way to correct individual outlier values. The package includes two main functions: `find_outliers()` and `correct_outliers()`, for finding and correcting outliers, respectively.

Let's take a look at these functions in action.

### Detecting outliers in example data

The package contains an example dataset `silk_data1` which we can use to demonstrate the functionality of the package.

```{r example}
library(silk)
## basic example code
data("silk_data1")

silk_data1 |> 
  head()

```

If we visualize the data, we see that there are a few unusual values in the data.

```{r visualize-example-data, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
library(ggplot2)

silk_data1 |> 
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = time, y = y, color = group)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::theme_bw() +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~group) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "top")
```

We can detect these unsual data points usign the `silk::find_outliers()` function, which takes a data.frame and a column name as input, and returns a modified version of the input data.frame.


```{r}
silk_data1 |> 
  silk::find_outliers(col = "y", group_col = "group") |>
  head()
```

As we can see, the function has added new columns to the data. The  `.outlier` column indicates whether a value is an outlier or not.

### Visulizing the outliers

```{r visualize-outliers, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}

silk_data1 |> 
  silk::find_outliers(col = "y", group_col = "group") |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = time, y = y)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(color = .outlier)) +
  ggplot2::theme_bw() +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~group) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "top")
```


<!--
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
