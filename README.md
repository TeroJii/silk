The goal of silk is to make curves with outliers smooth as silk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of silk from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TeroJii/silk")
```

## Example

The objective of this package is to provide a simple way to correct
individual outlier values. The package includes two main functions:
`find_outliers()` and `correct_outliers()`, for finding and correcting
outliers, respectively.

Letâ€™s take a look at these functions in action.

### Detecting outliers in example data

The package contains an example dataset `silk_data1` which we can use to
demonstrate the functionality of the package.

``` r
library(silk)
## basic example code
data("silk_data1")

silk_data1 |> 
  head()
#>   time         y   group
#> 1    1  8.584244 series1
#> 2    2  9.159694 series1
#> 3    3  9.717704 series1
#> 4    4 10.249923 series1
#> 5    5 10.748432 series1
#> 6    6 11.205878 series1
```

The `silk::find_outliers()` functions takes a data.frame and a column
name as input, and returns a modified version of the input data.frame,
which includes columns for median, MAD and a logical column to indicate
outliers.

``` r
silk_data1 |> 
  find_outliers(col = "time", group_col = "group") |>
  head()
#>   time         y   group .median   .mad .outlier
#> 1    1  8.584244 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
#> 2    2  9.159694 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
#> 3    3  9.717704 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
#> 4    4 10.249923 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
#> 5    5 10.748432 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
#> 6    6 11.205878 series1   500.5 370.65    FALSE
```

<!--
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
&#10;You can also embed plots, for example:
&#10;
&#10;In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
